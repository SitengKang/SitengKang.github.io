I am a forth-year Ph.D. candidate advised by [Prof. Xinhua Zhang](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~zhangx/) in the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois Chicago. My research interest is the robustness and trustworthiness in machine learning involving temporal data such as continual learning, reinforcement learning, and language models.

Before that, I was advised by [Prof. Eli Upfal](https://cs.brown.edu/people/eupfal/) and [Dr. Cyrus Cousins](https://cs.brown.edu/~ccousins/) at Brown University on Statistical Machine Learning. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Pennsylvania State University under the supervision of [Prof. James Wang](https://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/home.shtml). I also fortunately advised by  [Prof. Jeremiah Blocki](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jblocki/) as visiting research assistant in Purdue University.
