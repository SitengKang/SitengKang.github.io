Bio
======
I am a forth-year Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Xinhua Zhang](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~zhangx/) in the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois Chicago. My research focus is the safety and trustworthiness in machine learning, especially tasks with tamporal input data.

Before that, I was working with [Prof. Eli Upfal](https://cs.brown.edu/people/eupfal/) and [Dr. Cyrus Cousins](https://cs.brown.edu/~ccousins/) at Brown University on Statistical Machine Learning.
