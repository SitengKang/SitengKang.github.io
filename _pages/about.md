I am a forth-year Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Xinhua Zhang](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~zhangx/) in the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois Chicago. My research intesert is the robustness and trustworthiness in machine learning. I'm currently focusing on tasks with tamporal data, including continual learning, reinforcement learning, and large language model.

Before that, I was advised by [Prof. Eli Upfal](https://cs.brown.edu/people/eupfal/) and [Dr. Cyrus Cousins](https://cs.brown.edu/~ccousins/) at Brown University on Statistical Machine Learning. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University under the supervision of [Prof. James Wang](https://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/home.shtml). I also fortunately advised by  [Prof. Jeremiah Blocki](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jblocki/) as visiting research assistant in Purdue University.
