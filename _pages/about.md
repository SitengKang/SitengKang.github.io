My research intesert is the safety and trustworthiness in machine learning, currently focusing on tasks with tamporal training data.

Before that, I was advised by [Prof. Eli Upfal](https://cs.brown.edu/people/eupfal/) and [Dr. Cyrus Cousins](https://cs.brown.edu/~ccousins/) at Brown University on Statistical Machine Learning. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University under the supervision of [Prof. James Wang](https://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/home.shtml). I also fortunately advised by  [Prof. Jeremiah Blocki](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jblocki/) as visiting research assistant in Purdue University.
